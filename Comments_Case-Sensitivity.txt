Comment in different Tech Stacks :

1. Programming Languages :
    a) C++ : 
        Single line = // text 
        Multiple line = /* text */
    
    b) JAVA :
    c) Pyhton : 
            Single line = # text 
            Multiple line = """ text """
    d) JS : 

2. Front-End
    a) HTML : <!-- text -->
    b) hbs : {{!-- comment --}} → safe, won’t render in HTML.
    c) CSS : /* text */
    d) SCSS : 
        Single line = // text  (but it will be removed by pre-processor as CSS don't understand '//')
        Multiple line = /* text */ 
    e) JS : //

3. Database
    a) SQL, PL-SQL : 
        Single line = -- text
        Multiple line =   /* text */
    b) 

4. Back-End
    a)

Case-Sensitivity in different Tech Stacks :

1. Programming Languages :
    a) C++ : Sensative (written in Lower-case mostly)
    b) JAVA : Sensative (keyword are in Lowercase only, but - see exception point 2)
    c) Python : Sensative (All are in Lowercase except - True, False and None)
    d) JS : 

2. Front-End
    a) HTML : In-sensitive
        X-HTML : Sensitive
    b) CSS : Sensitive & In-sensitive Both (see below in Exception point 1)
    c) JS : Sensative

3. Database
    a) SQL, PL-SQL : In-sensitive (but write in Upper-case)
    b) 

4. Back-End
    a) 


Exceptions :
    1. CSS selectors are generally case-insensitive, this includes class and ID selectors. So, CSS properties, values, pseudo class names, pseudo element names, element names are case INsensitive. 
        - But HTML class names are case-sensitive. And CSS class, id , urls, font-families are case sensitive

    2. By convention, Java programs are written entirely in lower-case characters with three exceptions :
        - The first letter of class names are capitalized to distinguish class names from member names.
        - The names of constant fields are written entirely capital letters. e.g., the built-in Java class Integer includes the constant static fields MIN_VALUE and MAX_VALUE.
        - The first letter in each word in a compound identifier after the first are capitalized. e.g., the built-in Java class Object includes a method called toString(). The capital S signifies the beginning of a word within the compound name toString().

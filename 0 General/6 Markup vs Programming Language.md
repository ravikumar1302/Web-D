# Difference between Markup Language and Programming Languagge

### Markup Language

-   A markup language is a way to annotate text so that a computer (or browser, or software) can process it and decide how it should be displayed or structured.

-   It does **Not** perform computation (no loops, no if/else, no arithmetic).
-   Examples:

    -   HTML (HyperText Markup Language) → structures web pages.
    -   XML (eXtensible Markup Language) → stores and transports data.
    -   Markdown → formats plain text (bold, headings, lists, etc.).

    👉 Markup languages describe data and its presentation/structure, not behavior.

### Programming Language

-   A programming language is used to write instructions for a computer to execute.
-   It can perform computation, control flow, and manipulate data.
-   Examples:

    -   Java, Python, C++ → general-purpose programming.
    -   JavaScript → programming for the web.

    👉 Programming languages define behavior (what the computer should do).

## Key Differences

| Feature                 | Markup Language (HTML, XML)             | Programming Language (Java, Python)         |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**             | Describe structure/format of data       | Define logic, algorithms, computation       |
| **Execution**           | Interpreted by parsers (browsers, etc.) | Executed by compilers/interpreters          |
| **Logic & Computation** | ❌ No loops, no conditionals, no math   | ✅ Has loops, conditionals, functions, etc. |
| **Output**              | A structured document or styled text    | A program that performs tasks               |
| **Examples**            | HTML, XML, Markdown                     | Python, Java, C++, JavaScript               |
